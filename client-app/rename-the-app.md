# Rename the app

The rename process is a bit tricky. That is why we made a video, to correctly explain you how to do it. Please look the video in details, every steps is mandatory, and if you miss some, you will face with errors. 

This step is commonly skipped by our clients, since it is a bit boring and they want to directly start the app. But note that if you skip this step at first, you will need to do the job of installing twice, and you may get errors. That is why this step is required at this stage.
